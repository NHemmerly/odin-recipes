        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Garlic <em>naan</em> is a type of Indian soft bread comparable to 
                pita bread. Traditionally, naan is made with a yeast-raised dough 
                that is then placed flat against the walls of a tandoor oven.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine together <em>water, sugar, and yeast.</em> Let sit for <em>
                    5-10 minutes</em> or until the mixture begins to bubble on top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the <em>milk, yogurt, oil, minced garlic, flour, baking powder,
                    and salt.</em> Mix until the dough comes together with your hands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Use floured hands to knead
                    the dough untill smooth, around <em>3-5 minutes</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly grease the same mixing bowl with a small spray of cooking oil.
                    Transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest
                    at room temperature for about <em>an hour</em> until doubled in size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When ready to cook, divide the dough into <em>10 equal pieces.</em>
                    Roll into balls, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece of dough 
                    into a large oval, about <em>6-inches long</em> and <em>1/8 inch thick.</em>
                    Repeat with remaining dough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over
                    with <em>1/2 teaspoon</em> of the extra olive oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until
                    bubbles form on top, about <em>1-2 minutes.</em> While cooking, 
                    brush the top with a little oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flip and cook for another <em>1-2 minutes,</em> until large golden
                    spots appear on the bottom. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from the skillet and wrap in a clean kitchen towel. Repeat 
                    with the remaining naan.
                </li>
            </ol>
