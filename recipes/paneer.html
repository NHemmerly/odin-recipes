        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><em><strong>Paneer</strong></em> is a type of Indian soft cheese
            made from compressing curdled milk. Paneer is found in many different 
            Indian dishes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>1 1/2 liters</em> full fat milk
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>2 to 3 tablespoons</em> vinegar
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <em>Pour</em> milk to a heavy bottom pot and bring it to a gentle boil on a medium heat.
                    Stir occaisionally to ensure the milk doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the milk boils, place a colander over a large bowl to collect the whey. Spread a 
                    cheese cloth over the colander.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the milk starts to boil, remove the pot from heat and add the <em>2 tablespoons</em> of 
                    vinegar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir well for <em>1 to 2 minutes</em> until the entire pot of milk curdles completely.
                    If done correctly, the whey will be clear rather than milky. <em>If the milk doesn't 
                    curdle completely, add one tablespoon vinegar and place on heat. 
                    </em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gently pour the curdled milk and whey onto the colander. Quickly cool the paneer by pouring
                    cold water over it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rinse the paneer to remove the smell and taste of the vinegar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wring out the paneer in the cheese cloth. Squeeze out as much whey and water as possible.
                    Make a knot in the cheese cloth and hang for <em>30 mins</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the knot and place the cheese cloth with the paneer onto a flat board. Press the paneer
                    with a heavy object to set the paneer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After <em>3-4 hours</em> remove the paneer, chop the paneer into cubes and the recipe is complete!
