# odin-recipes
A project from The Odin Project. A simple recipe website to demonstrate what I learned about HTML in the foundations of HTML section.


The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Create a multiple page website, with an index.html file as well as several other .html files that store my favorite recipes

2. The index.html page should link to all other pages of my website 

3. Each page should link back to the index.html page of my website
